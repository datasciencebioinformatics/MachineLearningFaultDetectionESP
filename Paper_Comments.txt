This review shows a model for vbration data. Importantly, a plot frequency versus amplitude is shown. In the same plot, corresponding frequency bands for each different fault types. Moreover, vibration analysis in ESP systems are discussed.

This paper discussess clearly time-domain analysis and frequency-domain analysis.

# Vibration data treatment can be applied to enable clusterinf of espetrum data according to the condition of the equipmment. Inicial literature review pointed to empirical mode decomposition as a default choice for transoforming spectral data [https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/16/9870, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2949891024006493, https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/16/9870, https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/16/9870]. An R package was already selected to apply Empirical Mode Decomposition to the test set ESPSet [emd: Empirical Mode Decomposition].
